# MrESP-1
Our friend Team Onion and our team just released the Development Tutorial of One MindControl Demo about how to make it with Omega 2, 
their Docks (EXP DOCK, RELAY EXP DOCK), Mr.ESP 1,and USB module dongle.
The Omega2 can easily fit into your DIY project or commercial product. 
It is less than 1/4 the size of the Raspberry Pi, and less than 1/3 the size of the Arduino Uno. 
The Omega2 is a full computer running Linux. Omega2 can be programmed with whatever language you want, such as python. 

Let’s do the interesting experiment, using EEG to control the Omega Relay LED.
First, the required materials and introduction:

Second, the circuit connection:
To complete the tasks, you need to connect the circuits first, so let's take a look at the circuit block.
 
Thirdly, Programming with python and uploading program
